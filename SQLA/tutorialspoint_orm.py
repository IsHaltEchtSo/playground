LEARNINGS

mapping used to create objects that represent rows of a table
a session is an adapter that communicates between programm and database
every session has its own flush-deposit and transactions can only be viewed from other sessions upon commiting them/storing them persistent on disk
the query object is a select statement that can be further adjusted (filter, update, delete, group, ...)
the result of a query is either a list of scalars or a scalar
textual sql can be used in sql expressions, also with bound parameters
relationship-construct creates an attribute to access objects from linked tables (via pkey) 
as long as objects are connected via a relationship-attribute it doesn't matter which object you add/commit via session
joins are great to retrieve pairs of rows but accessing the relationship-attribute is more suited to see all related rows to one row
subqueries, functions and joins are used to create sophisticaed queries
lazy load for in-time loading of associated rows, eager load to query all associated rows beforehand
define the cascading type in relationship to configure how deletes/updates/... propagate to related objects

# DECLARE MAPPING
"""
describe the database tables, then match them with classes
declarative system automatically maps classes to the db tables
declarative base is a catalog of classes and tables mapped together
the metadata object is stored inside of the base as well
